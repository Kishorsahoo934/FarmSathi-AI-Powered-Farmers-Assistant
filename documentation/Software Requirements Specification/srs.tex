\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
Managing crop and fertilizer recommendations manually can be challenging, especially when data varies based on soil type, environmental factors, and crop requirements. The \textbf{FarmSathi} application is designed to simplify and streamline the process of recommending suitable crops and fertilizers based on real-time data. It ensures farmers receive accurate insights and suggestions tailored to their specific agricultural conditions, enabling better productivity and sustainability. 

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is intended for developers, project managers, agricultural experts, end-users (farmers), and testers. It comprehensively overviews the system's internal, external, functional, and non-functional requirements. Stakeholders can use this document as a reference to understand the scope, features, and interactions within the FarmSathi system.

\section{Project Scope}  
\textbf{FarmSathi} creates an interactive platform for farmers to make informed decisions about crop selection and fertilizer usage based on soil and environmental conditions. The system integrates machine learning algorithms with real-time user input to enhance agricultural practices and productivity.  
\newline
\newline
Farmers can input soil nutrient levels, moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters to receive crop and fertilizer recommendations. The platform provides insights through statistical analysis and visualization, empowering farmers with data-driven solutions.  
\newline
Key functionalities include:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Crop Recommendation}: Suggests the most suitable crops for the given soil and environmental conditions using advanced machine learning models.
    \item \textbf{Fertilizer Recommendation}: Provides optimal fertilizer recommendations to maximize crop yield and maintain soil health.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Analysis}: Offers graphical insights into soil and crop data trends to improve farming strategies.
\end{itemize}
\newline
The roles and interactions are defined as follows:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Farmers}: The primary users who input data and receive recommendations. Farmers can also view statistical graphs better to understand the relationships between crop yields and environmental factors.
    \item \textbf{System Database}: Stores all relevant soil, crop, and fertilizer data for efficient processing and prediction.
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning Models}: Analyze inputs and generate recommendations.
\end{enumerate}

%     \caption{Entire work-flow of FarmSathi}
%     \label{fig:FarmSathi}
% \end{figure}

\textbf{The entire Work-flow} illustrates the main functional interactions:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Farmers provide \textit{soil and environmental data} as inputs to the system.
    \item The \textit{Crop Recommendation Module} predicts the best crops based on the inputs.
    \item The \textit{Fertilizer Recommendation Module} suggests fertilizers tailored to the selected crop and soil conditions.
    \item The \textit{Statistical Analysis Module} generates graphical insights to support sustainable farming practices.
\end{enumerate}
\newline
\textbf{System Workflow}: The database interacts with the crop and fertilizer recommendation models to retrieve relevant data, process inputs, and generate accurate outputs. Insights from the statistical analysis module further enhance the system's utility.  
\newline
This workflow ensures that all entities are interconnected and that the system delivers actionable, precise, and sustainable solutions for modern farming.  

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
The "FarmSathi" system is a modern solution aimed at helping farmers make informed decisions by providing crop and fertilizer recommendations based on various environmental and soil conditions. Traditionally, farmers used manual methods for selecting crops and fertilizers, relying on limited data and experience. This website-based application aims to streamline that process by utilizing machine learning algorithms to suggest optimal farming choices. The primary goal of this project is to improve agricultural efficiency by minimizing guesswork and maximizing crop yield.

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
"FarmSathi" has three primary types of users:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Registered Users (Farmers who use the system to input soil and climate data and receive recommendations)
    \item Admin (Responsible for managing user accounts and ensuring proper data is entered)
\end{itemize}
Farmers are the primary users who input data related to their fields, including soil conditions, climate, and historical crop performance. Agricultural experts can provide additional insights and updates to recommendations based on changing trends and data. System administrators manage the website's backend, ensuring the smooth operation of the platform.
